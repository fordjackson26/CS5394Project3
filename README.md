<h4>Background Info</h4>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Mario Kart Wii is one of my favorite games and has been for over 10 years.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">With the evolulion of the game a competetive comunity has formed and there are thousands of players playing daily.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">There are 32 track in the game nativly and you can see your statistics on all the tracks through the matches you have played</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">My goal was to make and train a model to predict a players mmr based on their<ul style=" font-family:courier;"><li>Average Placement</li><li>Fastest Time</li><li>Number of Times played</li></ul></p>



<p>These elements were chosen because they are quickly accesible for all players using the command <br><code style="font-size330%;">?besttracks rt</code> in the main community discord server.</p>
